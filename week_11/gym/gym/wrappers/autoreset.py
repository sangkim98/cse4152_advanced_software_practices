class AutoResetWrapper(gym.Wrapper):
    """A class for providing an automatic reset functionality for gym environments when calling :meth:`self.step`.

    When calling step causes :meth:`Env.step` to return done, :meth:`Env.reset` is called,
    and the return format of :meth:`self.step` is as follows: ``(new_obs, terminal_reward, terminal_done, info)``
     - ``new_obs`` is the first observation after calling :meth:`self.env.reset`
     - ``terminal_reward`` is the reward after calling :meth:`self.env.step`, prior to calling :meth:`self.env.reset`.
     - ``terminal_done`` is always True
     - ``info`` is a dict containing all the keys from the info dict returned by the call to :meth:`self.env.reset`,
       with an additional key "terminal_observation" containing the observation returned by the last call to :meth:`self.env.step`
       and "terminal_info" containing the info dict returned by the last call to :meth:`self.env.step`.

    Warning: When using this wrapper to collect rollouts, note that when :meth:`Env.step` returns done, a
        new observation from after calling :meth:`Env.reset` is returned by :meth:`Env.step` alongside the
        terminal reward and done state from the previous episode.
        If you need the terminal state from the previous episode, you need to retrieve it via the
        "terminal_observation" key in the info dict.
        Make sure you know what you're doing if you use this wrapper!
